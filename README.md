# koustav_summarization_sigir_2018
Contains codes and datasets related to sub-event identification and summarizing information during disaster
Our SIGIR paper "Identifying Sub-events and Summarizing Information during Disasters" consists of two parts --- 1. Sub-event detection and 2. Summarization of information using different small scale information
Long ranging natural disasters span over quite a few days and information is scattered across different humanitarian classes like infrastructure, missing, shelter, volunteer etc. We have considered three different disasters Nepal earthquake, Typhoon Hagupit, and Pakistan flood in this paper
Dataset directory contains Tweet-IDs and ground truth summaries used in this project.
Codes directory contains codes and a README containing information about how to run those codes.
For details --- please go through the paper!!
